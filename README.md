# Salesforce_Challenge
This is a mini project that represents a REST API creation that communicates with SF API in order to get and treat data.

# Technologies used:
nodejs, expressjs, jsforce, nodemon

# Exercices done with their Endpoints
* task 1:  Fetch a given candidate usign their ID /myapi/candidate/:candidateID'
* task 2:  Add new candidate with my data : /myapi/candidate
* task 3:  Edit Last_Name of a given candidate /myapi/candidate/:candidateID
* task 4:  Get all candidates /myapi/candidates

# Exercices not done
* task 5, 6, 7, 8

# Extra exercices
* check the users connection information: /myapi/candidateExpert/
* Delete a candidtae given their ID : '/myapi/candidate/:candidateID'
* Fetch all candidates with more than 3 years experience : 

# Clarification on the tests
As i couldnt authentificate your SF user, i used my own SF user that i created with dev edition.
Nnowing that the sobject of candidature is not available in my SF account, i used the Account object in order to test my Endpoints logic.
